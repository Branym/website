## Introduction

This case study presents the redesign process of a finance educational platform, "Education10x," with a target audience of children aged 6-14. The primary goal was to create an engaging and visually stimulating website for a platform that teaches financial literacy to young learners in a fun and interactive way.

## Understanding the Target Audience

Extensive research was conducted to understand the characteristics, preferences, and cognitive abilities of the target audience. The research emphasized the importance of a playful and visually stimulating design to captivate the interest of young learners.

## UI/UX & Logo Design

A new logo was created to reflect the essence of the platform and appeal to children. The logo featured bright and vibrant colors.
The UI/UX design phase focused on creating an intuitive and engaging user experience. We utilized a playful theme, integrating vibrant colors throughout the website. Clear and simple navigation was implemented to ensure ease of use for young users. The website was redesigned to align with the new brand identity and cater to the target audience. The homepage showcased key features, and educational resources. Custom illustrations and icons were developed based on the content, making complex financial concepts visually understandable and relatable for children.

## Color Palette Selection

A diverse and colorful palette was carefully chosen to make the website visually appealing and engaging for kids. Bright and lively hues were used strategically to highlight important elements and evoke a sense of excitement and curiosity. The color scheme aimed to create a cheerful and positive learning environment.

## Parental Engagement

Recognizing the importance of parental involvement, the platform incorporated features to engage parents in their child's learning journey. Parent-specific sections provided resources, progress tracking, and suggested activities to reinforce financial literacy concepts at home. The design aimed to create a seamless experience for both children and parents.
