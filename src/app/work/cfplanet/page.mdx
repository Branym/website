The objective of this case study is to outline the process of designing and developing a social media website, “CoFounders Planet” The goal was to create a platform that offers entrepreneurs a place to interact with each other and collaborate with likeminded business entusiasts who share the same vision and goals.

## User Research

Extensive user research was conducted to understand the target audience and their preferences. Surveys, interviews, and usability tests were conducted to gather insights and identify user pain points. The research revealed the need for intuitive navigation, privacy controls, content personalization, and real-time interactions.

## UI/UX Design and Development

As we were given a very narrow timeline to build the platform, we choose to jump on the development of MVP, and the developers having a great knowlege of UI made the first look of the platform which met the industry standards and got approved on the first go.

We continued to improve visual elements, color schemes, typography and icons on the codebase. We used NextJS Framework for a better SEO and Server Side Rendering (SSR). We adopted an agile methodology to ensure flexibility and faster delivery. The project was divided into 2 phases, based on the features.

## Deployment and Maintainence

The website was deployed on a cloud infrastructure Amazon AWS EC2, for more scalability and availability. Feedback from beta users was gathered to make final refinements before the public release.

Designing and developing a social media website requires meticulous planning, iterative design, and agile development methodologies. This case study presented an overview of the process, emphasizing the importance of user research, intuitive design, scalable development, and continuous improvement. The successful launch and adoption of **CoFounders Planet** validate the effectiveness of the implemented strategies, highlighting the impact of a well-designed social media platform on fostering online communities.
